# Multibeam Fixed-Satellite Service Simulator

Graphical simulator in [MATLAB®](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/) that aims to assist in the design (ground segment architecture, frequency reuse plan, link budget calculations, ...) of a fixed-satellite service with multibeam coverage over Europe.

## About
This software was developed as part of a course in Satellite Communications at the [Polytechnic University of Madrid](http://www.upm.es), for a project titled “**Design of a multibeam satellite for Europe (FSS):** Comparison of performance with Ka vs Q/V feeder links”.

The objective was to compare the impact of using Ka band or Q/V band feeder links in the throughput, transponder achitecture and ground segment of a multibeam fixed-satellite service. A graphical simulator was to be developed to assist in the preliminary design of the system in both scenarios.
