# multibeam: Graphical simulator for multibeam FSS design

Graphical simulator in [MATLAB®](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/) that aims to assist in the design (ground segment architecture, frequency reuse plan, link budget calculations, ...) of a fixed-satellite service with multibeam coverage over Europe.


## About
This software was developed as part of a course in Satellite Communications at the [Polytechnic University of Madrid](http://www.upm.es), for a project titled *“Design of a multibeam satellite for Europe (FSS): Comparison of performance with Ka vs Q/V feeder links”*.
